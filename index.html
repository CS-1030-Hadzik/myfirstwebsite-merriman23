                  <p class="card-text">In addition to learning python, I am also taking CS 1400 this semester in which I am learning some Java. Much like with Python, I can't make any programs that are too complicated, but I made a repository with a couple of the projects that I've completed up to now. They are both pretty basic, but the first one is a coin flipping simulator in which you can specify how many coins you'd like to flip; you can also make a prediction as to whether heads or tails gets flipped more frequently and the program will tell you if you were right. The second program just tells the user how many days are in the month that the user specifies based on the year that the user selects.</p>
